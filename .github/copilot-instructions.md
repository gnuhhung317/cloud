This is a comprehensive learning repository designed for preparing for Viettel IDC positions. The repository follows the 20/80 principle (Pareto principle) focusing on the most critical 20% of knowledge that provides 80% of job benefits.

## Core Learning Philosophy
- **Theory + Practice**: Always combine theoretical foundations with hands-on implementation
- **Enterprise Focus**: Target enterprise-level scenarios common in telecommunications infrastructure
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start with fundamentals, build to advanced enterprise implementations
- **Real-world Application**: Every concept should have direct application to Viettel IDC operations

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into 7 main modules:
1. **Operating Systems** (Linux/Windows)
2. **Virtualization and Cloud** (VMware, OpenStack, AWS, Azure)
3. **Container Management** (Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD)
4. **Database Management** (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle, MySQL)
5. **Automation Tools** (Ansible, Terraform)
6. **Programming Languages** (Python, Java)
7. **Soft Skills** (Logic thinking, problem-solving, documentation)

## Code Generation Guidelines
